My site for sharing projects I've made.

* First up, we have the [LCR simulator](/demos/lcr.htm). I planned on making it much fancier and then I didn't do that so... it is what it is.

* Next, I am currently developing a board game of my own creation. It is still under construction but you can check out my progress [here](/games/pirates_vs_mermaids.htm).
