My site for sharing projects I've made.

* First up, we have the [LCR simulator](/demos/lcr.htm). I planned on making it much fancier and then I didn't do that so... it is what it is.

* Next, I am currently developing a board game of my own creation. The prototype I am using for playtesting can be found [here](/games/pirates_vs_mermaids.htm).

* I am working on my own take on the gamified pomodoro timer. I call it [Idle Pomodoro Adventure](/games/idle_pomodoro_adventure.htm). This is a work in progress, but woodcutting and foraging are mostly fully implemented, with more features on the way. It already works fine as a pomodoro timer.

* I have adapted some puzzles, some for use in lessons and some for fun. They can be found [here](/puzzles/index.html).
